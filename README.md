This package implements the self triggered controller synthesis algorithm for safe execution from the paper titled `Safe Self-Triggered Control Based on PrecomputedReachability Sequences`.  The paper will appear in the `26th ACM International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control` conference.  A preliminary version of the paper is given in the [following link](https://asarvind.github.io/SafeSelfTriggered.jl/blob/main/docs/paper.pdf).
